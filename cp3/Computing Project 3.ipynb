    "=================================\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing Probabilities over time for the Infinite Square Well\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This project capitalizes on the first two projects by introducing\n",
    "a \"real\" system for which we can find exact solutions to the Schr\\\"odinger equation\n",
    "and simulate the behavior of the system over time. Two beneficial side effects of completing\n",
    "this project are that you'll learn how to make real time graphs in vpython and\n",
    "you'll learn some tricks for computing probabilities numerically with discretized (sampled) wave functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Problem\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 2.8 (page 40, Griffiths, 2nd ed.) reads: A particle of mass $m$ in the\n",
    "infinite square well (of width $a$) starts out in the left half of the well,\n",
    "and is (at $t=0$) equally likely to be found at any point in that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) What is the inital wave function $\\Psi(x,0)$? (Assume that it is real. Don't forget to normalize it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) What is the probability that a measurement of the energy would yield the value $\\pi^2\\hbar^2/2ma^2$?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to solve this problem computationally and model the behavior of the wavefunction to you can visualize what's happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Analytical Solution\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We worked out the normalization and coefficients for HW 2.8 in class. If you're careful you should find the wave function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Psi(x, 0) = \n",

    "are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "c_n = \\frac{2}{n\\pi} \\left ( 1 - \\cos(\\frac{n \\pi}{2}) \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $\\psi_n(x)$ are the stationary state solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\psi_n(x) = \\sqrt{(2/a)} \\sin(\\frac{n \\pi}{a} x)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out the \"probability of measuring $E_n$ in this state\" is $|c_n|^2$, so we have the answer to part b as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "At later times we saw that each stationary state component of the wavefunction  evolves simply with an $e^{-i\\omega_n t}$ phase \n",
    "factor according to the energy $\\hbar \\omega_n$ of each state (where $\\omega_n$ is determined by the kinetic\n",
    "energy in the $n$th state, $p_n^2/2m = (\\hbar k_n)^2/2m = n^2 \\hbar \\omega_1$ .), so that the net wavefunction is simply:\n",

    "\n",
    "Please include at least one screen capture of your wavefunction and include it in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) A graph of the probability of finding the particle in the range $x<(a/2)$ as a function of the phase\n",
    "of $\\psi_1$ for a period of time equivalent to two full cycles of the ground state component of the wavefunction.\n",
    "With my setup I get a graph that looks like Fig 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) A graph of the expectation value of $\\langle x \\rangle$ as a function of time, for the same time period as (2) above. If you really want to \n",
    "impress me you can include graphs of $\\langle x \\rangle \\pm \\sigma$ as well! Your graph might look something like Fig. 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: If you set $\\omega_1$=1, then your time units will essentially be equal to the\n",
    "phase of $\\psi_1$. You can always choose other time units, but this will be simplest.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions that need to be answered as part of the report require you to \n",
