# qm-computing-projects

This is a repo of computing projects for my upper level quantum course.

You can run many of these projects with no installation:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sspickle/qm-computing-projects/master)

The easiest way to get things going is with anaconda:

    conda env create -f environment.yml (on a Mac)

or

    conda env create -f win-environment.yml (on Windows)

Then activate the environment using:

     source activate vpenv

I hope someone finds this useful!
